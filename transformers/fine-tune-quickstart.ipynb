I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

Trust me if you have to do a turn around please and must do! \\n\\nYou walk into a semi light modern designed room, welcomed warmly by the staff not yelled at from across the room.

Like in big, bold letters with lots of underlining and specialized font.\\n\\nMy hubby and I went there for a romantic yet chill dinner, and this place didn't disappoint.  It's got a trendy, dark, cool ambiance with lots of candles.  We were promptly seated at one of the cute high tops and had an awesome waitress.\\n\\nStarted off with the pumpkin mixed drink - and this is my only complaint really.  It was a little thick and hard to suck up the straw.  And the glass was FILLED with ice, which kept plunking in my face.  No so sexy.\\n\\nBut all of the food we ordered was divine!  The concept is small plates, like tapas. We got the butternut squash soup (which they thoughtfully divided up for us into two bowls rather than letting us make asses of ourselves passing the bowl back and forth) which was very sweet, dessert-like is what my hubby said.  The pork belly sandwich was great - not quite as amazing as what others had written, but still fabulous.  The scallops were INCREDIBLE!  I typically don't like scallops, but if they were typically prepared like this, I would ALWAYS order them!  They were fluffy and light, prepared with an incredible risotto like side dish.  Our final dinner plate was the garganelli, which was by far my favorite.  It was a little spicy, just enough for a kick.  The sausage was incredible!\\n\\nWe couldn't pass up on dessert.  I had a chocolate-espresso pot de creme - fabulously rich in a great way.  I had a tough time finishing it though.  It's a little heavy, but not in a fudge way where you can feel it from the first bite.  You think you can finish the whole thing, but then the heaviness slowly sneaks up on you.  Or maybe I just ate too much in general.  Hubby had the pumpkin cake, which was quite delish too.  Can't comment on the cheesecake ice cream as I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but judging on how he ate all of his dessert without barely offering to share, I think he was quite happy.\\n\\nAll in all, yummy, fabulous place for a date night.  Although I saw some groups of friends who seemed to be having a good time too.</td>\n",

After 15 minutes, spewing out of a partial life story and some pretty horrific gum smacking inches from my face (all on HER parth, ha), my brows were \\\"done.\\\" They were decently shaped (nothing special) but the clean up was atrocious.

What I love about this place is that it's extremely spacious and even has large couches for you to sit on as you enjoy your frozen yogurt. \\n\\nMy usual complaint about most frozen yogurt places, is that there are never enough flavors. But U-Swirl has so many to choose from EVERY DAY. And the flavors aren't typical either. You have anything from your classic Vanilla flavor, to Tart,  to Red Velvet! And they also have a wide range of toppings. When I first walked in and saw the selection I almost lost my mind. I was probably more excited than a 5 year old child! \\n\\nI usually mix the flavors in sections of my cup. I get Red Velvet, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, and Cheesecake. And for the toppings I put cheesecake bites, graham cracker crumbs, and white chocolate chips. Love it! Every time I go to a frozen yogurt place, I always compare it to U-Swirl.

We had (good) drinks at the bar while we waited, but there was another gentleman sitting at the bar, who I think worked there, who was extremely obnoxious and was hitting on all of the female employees. The hostess seemed to be his girlfriend and it came off very unprofessional. After telling us our wait would be longer, she offered to sit up in the empty dining room which we declined, because we didn't come to a restaurant to sit alone with no ambiance. \\n\\nOnce we were seated our experience improved. The environment was romantic and intimate and our server was great. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was underwhelming. I would not recommend it. Our entrees were delicious though. I had the tuna and my husband had the duck, and both meals were excellent. We also ordered the asparagus which we loved, and the cream corn with lobster which we sent back.
